DESCRIPTION: As part of my internship assignment, I was tasked with designing and implementing a simple compiler-like system using C++. The objective was to create a program capable of parsing and evaluating basic arithmetic expressions input by the user. The solution had to handle mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and nested parentheses, with proper handling of operator precedence and associativity.
To achieve this, I implemented a recursive descent parser that breaks down the expression into smaller components and evaluates them step by step. The parser follows the traditional grammar structure for arithmetic expressions, where:
An expression consists of one or more terms separated by + or -
A term consists of one or more factors separated by * or /
A factor can be a number, a negative number, or a full expression enclosed in parentheses
The main function serves as the user interface, accepting input from the console, passing it to the parser, and displaying the result or any parsing errors. The program also gracefully handles edge cases such as division by zero, missing parentheses, or invalid characters.This implementation demonstrates how core compiler concepts like lexical analysis, parsing, and evaluation can be applied in a simple, practical way using C++. It also lays a foundation for future enhancements like variable support, assignment operations, or expression trees.This project helped me strengthen my understanding of parsing techniques and reinforced key concepts in compiler design, such as token handling, grammar rules, and error management. The code is clean, modular, and written without the use of external libraries, making it easy to understand, maintain, and extend.
